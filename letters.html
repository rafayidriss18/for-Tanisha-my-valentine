<h1>letters batch 1 💌</h1>

<p id="sad">
i know there are days when your chest feels heavy and the world seems too loud and everything around you makes you feel smaller than you are and i wish i could be there to take your hand and make you feel that you are never alone even when things feel impossible i remember how soft you are how every little feeling matters and how your heart beats in a rhythm only i know and i wish i could hold you under the night sky again and tell you that nothing can break what we have nothing can dim the love that grows between us even in the darkest moments i promise that my arms will always be your safe place and my heart will always be your home and no matter what you feel right now i am here thinking about you loving you endlessly i remember the first kiss when everything felt infinite and i can feel that same magic every time i think of you and even when the day feels heavy i wish i could be your whisper your calm your presence your everything because loving you is the most natural thing in the world and every beat of my heart belongs to you and i hope when you read this you feel me there holding you and reminding you that we are unbreakable and nothing can ever take you away from me and you are my favorite everything and i love you beyond words and time and space and i will keep loving you forever and ever and nothing will ever change that promise and i am always yours forever
</p>

<p id="happy">
when you are happy the air around you feels lighter and your laughter fills everything and it pulls me closer even when we are apart i think about how your eyes sparkle and your smile spreads warmth in a way that i have never seen before i remember the day i surprised you and slid the promise ring onto your finger and how your entire face lit up and i could feel your joy in every inch of your being and that is the kind of happiness i want to give you forever to see your heart glow to see your energy shine to be part of every small and big moment that makes you feel alive because your happiness is the most beautiful thing i know and i will spend every day trying to make you smile as much as you make me fall deeper in love with you i love the way you tease me when you are playful and how your soft words make me melt and even your dramatic little moments make me adore you even more and i want to celebrate every single version of you the silly the calm the emotional the dramatic the loving the teasing all of it and when you read this i hope you feel my heart with yours and know that your happiness is mine to cherish and protect forever and you are my everything and i love you beyond measure and time and space and i will spend every day making sure you feel that forever and nothing can change how i feel about you and you are my world my joy my light and i hope you never forget that
</p>

<p id="hug">
if you are reading this because you want a hug i wish i could be there right now to wrap you in my arms and hold you like the world does not exist outside of us to let you feel every ounce of my love in that embrace i remember the night sky when we first kissed above the city lights and how holding you close felt like holding eternity itself i want to hold you in every way possible to let you know that you are cherished safe wanted completely to remind you that your softness your clinginess your drama your calmness your teasing all of it is mine and i adore every part of it and if you close your eyes i hope you feel me there holding you even across the distance because my love is bigger than space bigger than time bigger than any longing and i will always hold you in every heartbeat i want to hold you when you feel weak when you feel strong when you feel happy when you feel sad i want to be your constant your warmth your home your everything and when the world is too heavy remember that you are loved and treasured and held and no matter what i am always here thinking about you dreaming about you and loving you endlessly i want to hold you like you are the only thing in existence and every part of you is mine to admire and protect forever and i hope this hug travels to you through every word

<p id="missing">
every moment without you feels longer and the world seems quieter and emptier and i wish i could be right there beside you to remind you that you are never alone i think about your laughter and your smile and how everything about you makes me feel alive and complete i remember our first kiss under the night sky above the city lights and the way time seemed to freeze around us and i feel that longing every time i am away from you and even when we are apart i carry you in my heart in every thought in every dream in every breath i hope you feel me with you across the distance because loving you has made every moment without you feel full with memories and hope and desire i want to be the comfort in your loneliness the whisper in your mind the warmth in your heart the constant presence that reminds you that you are loved deeply completely endlessly i wish i could reach through the miles and hold you close to let you know that nothing can diminish what we have that even when we are apart our souls are intertwined our hearts are joined and every beat of mine belongs to you and i think about every soft touch every playful tease every shared smile every dramatic sigh and it all makes me ache to be near you again and i promise when we are together next i will never let go
</p>

<p id="angry">
even when you are upset or angry i want you to know that every feeling you have is valid and every emotion you express is beautiful and i admire your honesty and your depth and your passion and even in moments of frustration i am here thinking about you and loving you and wanting to be your calm your anchor your safe place i remember the times we argued softly and even then i felt closer to you because i could see the fire in your heart and the love behind every word you said and i promise that i will always listen i will always care i will always try to understand because every part of you deserves to be seen and cherished and even when words get heated or tempers rise i am never going anywhere and every ounce of love i have for you grows stronger with every emotion you feel and even when storms come i want to be the quiet steady presence reminding you that nothing can break us and your anger is just another layer of your beauty and i will hold that with care forever and you are my everything
